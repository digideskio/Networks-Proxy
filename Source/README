Proxy (project 1)

I'm a 325 student who attempted the 425 bonus of DNS caching.
possible cache collisions from multithreaded use may lower performance increase, but that's discussed in DNSTable.java

It seems to work to me.  I've been leaving it on while I write the code, and haven't had major issues
complex sites (like the mentioned cnn.com) work just swimmingly.  Peachy keen, if you will.
persistent connections are not supported, and are overridden with Connection: close in the header

I've got nice javadocs and stuff, so that should help with readability.
I may have gone overboard with the number of classes, but I tend to think in a very object-oriented manner
I tried writing test code, but it's downright difficult and annoying when dealing with sockets, so I gave up.

Invoke it with
> java proxyd
    for port 5005 (my assigned port)
> java proxyd 50025
    for port 50025
> java proxyd something_here_is_ignored 50026 everything past here is ignored
    for port 50026
